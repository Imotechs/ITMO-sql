JOIN

SELECT * FROM Table1 Join Table2 ON Table1.Field1=Table2.Field2
'OR'
SELECT * FROM Table1,Table2 WHERE Table1.Field1=Table2.Field2

"the above will display list of only values that are present in both tables."

SELECT * FROM Students LEFT JOIN Phone_List ON Students.StudentId=Phone_List.StudentId
'Adding the LEFT will add all the values of the first table even if the secont table does not exits'
SELECT * FROM Students LEFT JOIN Phone_List ON Students.StudentId=Phone_List.StudentId ORDER BY Students.StudentId

we have 
RIGHT JOIN 'Returns values of the right Table even if it doesnt exist on the left'
FULL JOIN 'Returns all Values'

'We can perform a complex join by joining all the tables that are related by any field'
SELECT * FROM Students JOIN Exam_Result ON Students.StudentId=Exam_Result.StudentId 
JOIN St_Group ON Students.GroupCode=ST_Group.GroupCode
